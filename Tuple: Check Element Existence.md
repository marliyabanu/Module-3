# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 'z')
contains_n = 'n' in x
contains_8 = 8 in x
print("Does the tuple contain 'n'? :", contains_n)
print("Does the tuple contain 8?   :", contains_8)

## Result
A Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is excuted sucessful.
